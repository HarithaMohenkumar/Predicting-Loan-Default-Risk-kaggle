# Predicting-Loan-Default-Risk-kaggle

The dataset I used for this project is from the Home Credit Default Risk machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle in May 2018. There are 7 different data tables provided on the loan applicants and they are related to each other.

With my goal of keeping things concise, in this blog post I only work with the APPLICATION_TRAIN dataset.
Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR.
It comes with the TARGET indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid.
The objective is to use the given information to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan.
